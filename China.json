Since its founding in 1999, Alibaba has grown to be one of the world\u2019s largest companies. The conglomerate\u2019s US$25 billion initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 was the world\u2019s largest to date.\nLike any Chinese internet company listed on an overseas stock exchange, Alibaba was able to do so only via a legal structure known as \u2018variable interest entity\u2018, designed to get around China\u2019s foreign ownership laws. This investment method is highly risky, as Beijing could effectively confiscate the business at any time.\nDespite being one of China\u2019s premier internet companies, Alibaba has substantial foreign ownership, having sold significant stakes to Japanese conglomerate Softbank Group, which currently holds around 25%. As of January 2021, Alibaba\u2019s co-founder, Jack Ma (4.8%), together with co-founder and vice-chairman Joseph Tsai (11.9%) and Softbank Group are the company\u2019s controlling shareholders, followed by US asset management firm T Rowe Price Associates, Inc. (2.3%) and US investment firm BlackRock Fund Advisors (2%).", "areas_of_overseas": "Areas of Overseas Business Activity\nAlibaba focuses most of its investments on its core strengths as a company (e-commerce and logistics), and around 70% of those investments are in local Chinese firms. However, the company has also invested in various countries across the globe, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Singapore, the UAE and Switzerland. Its investment areas include biotech, logistics, security, food technology, media, cloud computing, payments, voice recognition, face recognition and health.\nThe company has made its most significant inroads overseas in Southeast Asia, which it refers to as \u2018an important region for our globalisation strategy\u2019 and where it boasts a strong lead over its US e-commerce rival, Amazon. In April 2016, Alibaba bought a controlling stake in Southeast Asian retailer Lazada Group for US$1 billion. It injected another US$3 billion into the business in the following years and replaced its CEO with a longstanding Alibaba executive.\nAlibaba\u2019s former chairman, Jack Ma, is a global ambassador for Chinese business and spruiks the benefits of open trade in meetings with heads of state and other foreign dignitaries at various world forums. Ma has linked Alibaba\u2019s international business expansion with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), telling the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2016 that the most important regions for his company were part of the BRI. When Ma met with then US President Donald Trump in January 2017, he promised that his company would help create 1 million jobs over five years in the US, but later went back on his promise, citing the ongoing US\u2013China trade war.\nOn 10 September 2019, Jack Ma retired and Daniel Zhang, who had been CEO since 2015, took over as the new chairman of Alibaba. Despite his retirement, Ma still holds a very high profile and is the de facto face of the company. When Chinese authorities started a crackdown on his two main companies (Alibaba and Ant Group), Ma disappeared from public view for several months after he voiced controversial critiques about the way China\u2019s regulators handle big businesses in the country. In January 2021, it was reported that Alibaba was subjected to an anti-trust investigation for \u2018suspected monopolistic practices\u2019 and fined almost US$100,000 for failing to comply with Chinese antitrust law. Additionally, in April, the company was fined an unprecedented US$2.8 billion for abusing \u2018its dominant position in the market\u2019. Commentators have described this as an emblematic case and an anti-monopoly statement by the government, as it was the first-time regulators went after such a high-profile Chinese tech company.\nAs of January 2021, Alibaba\u2019s active users were mostly China-based, but, looking ahead, Daniel Zhang has said that the company aims to reach more than 2 billion customers globally by 2036. This effort is being complemented with an increased focus on overseas influencer campaigns. As Beijing has cracked down on the company, however, Alibaba has reportedly halved its investment in start-ups over the second half of 2020.\nAlibaba\u2019s foreign investments haven\u2019t always been successful. On 2 January 2018, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) blocked the acquisition of Texas-based financial technology company, MoneyGram International, by Alibaba\u2019s financial arm, Ant Financial Services Group (See Ant Group under \u2018Companies\u2019). According to sources cited by Reuters, the deal was terminated after CFIUS rejected Ant Group\u2019s proposals to mitigate concerns over the safety of data that can be used to identify US citizens.", "party_state": "Party-state Activities\nSoon after its founding in 1999, a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) branch was established inside Alibaba; the branch was upgraded to a party committee in 2008. In total, there are almost 200 party branches and more than 7,000 party members at Alibaba and Ant Group, and around 600 new party members join the company every year. In March 2021, following the Chinese authorities\u2019 crackdown on Alibaba, the company opened a second party committee at its Beijing headquarters. At the founding ceremony for the committee, its secretary, Wang Hao, said that \u2018Alibaba should adhere to correct political directions and maintain political integrity.\u2019\nUnlike the CEOs who head the other two companies in the BAT troika (Baidu and Tencent), Alibaba\u2019s former head, Jack Ma, is a member of the CCP\u2015a fact that was only very recently revealed in the Chinese press. But, unlike Baidu\u2019s Robin Li and Tencent\u2019s Pony Ma, Jack Ma has never been appointed as a delegate to the National People\u2019s Congress. He was, however, a member of the 10th Zhejiang Provincial Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, from 2008 to 2012. Ma, alongside Baidu\u2019s Robin Li, was part of Xi Jinping\u2019s entourage when Xi became the first CCP General Secretary to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2017.\nAccording to a 2018 Reuters article, an Alibaba special projects team \u2018Y Projects Business Unit\u2019, which covers \u2018development projects outside the company\u2019, was responsible for developing the Party\u2019s Xuexi Qiangguo (\u2018Study to make China strong\u2019) mobile application. The CCP\u2019s Central Propaganda Department released the app, which was built using Alibaba\u2019s messaging app DingTalk. The ASPI ICPC report Engineering Global Consent found that Alibaba Cloud had a strategic cooperation agreement with the company Global Tone Communications Technology (GTCOM), which is the subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise directly controlled by the Central Propaganda Department. Alibaba is also one of several companies GTCOM claims it has collaborated with in the development of its technology, and GTCOM\u2019s US-based company also claimed to have reached strategic cooperation with Alibaba. \nAlibaba\u2019s technology is also used across China for government projects, for instance in smart cities projects. These projects typically involve the use of Alibaba\u2019s 'city brain' technology.", "activities_in_xinjiang": "Activities in Xinjiang\nAccording to a 2014 article in China Daily, \u2018Jack Ma and his top management team\u2019 visited Xinjiang, and signed a strategic partnership agreement with the Xinjiang government. As part of the agreement, the government said it would purchase Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing technologies to apply in areas of policing and counterterrorism.\nFor instance, Alibaba, together with Tencent and Hikvision, is reportedly involved in \u2018Smart Prison\u2019 projects across China. The projects are implemented across China, including in Xinjiang, according to reports by local prisons. \nSince the mass detention of Uyghurs in Xinjiang began in 2017, many Chinese companies have opened up \u2018satellite\u2019 factories in the province due to favourable government policies and abundant local labour (including forced labour). Uyghurs have been forced to work mostly for textile or electronics manufacturers, and some of the products are sold on Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce platforms. For instance, Yecheng Xiaoxiang Textile Company, which has satellite factories in Xinjiang, sells clothing on Alibaba\u2019s platforms to consumers in China, North America, Europe and the Middle East.\nIn December 2020, the New York Times reported that Alibaba had built a feature into its Cloud software to help online platforms \u2018detect the faces of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities\u2019, and showcased it on its website. Alibaba is also a substantial shareholder and partner of Megvii Technology Ltd, which is a Chinese AI company the US government has added to the Entity List for alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang.

At its overseas offices, China Mobile has reinforced its desire to create joint opportunities in 5G and IoT technologies.\nIn September 2018, China Mobile opened a South Africa office in Johannesburg. During the opening ceremony, it also signed a strategic cooperation agreement with MTN Group, which is South Africa\u2019s largest telecommunications company and provides access to 92% of the population. The partnership is a significant step in China Mobile\u2019s development in Africa, as MTN\u2019s network also reaches into Uganda, Rwanda, Cameroon and Nigeria. Through network and resource sharing, this partnership will extend the international network interconnection and enhance the international business expansion of both companies.\nChina Mobile Group\u2019s vice president stated that its expansion in Africa is a response to the \u2018Eight Major Actions\u2019 (under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative) raised by Xi Jinping at the 2018 Forum on China\u2013Africa Cooperation, and that it would further enhance network interconnections and technical exchanges in the areas of 5G and the IoT. The Chinese Embassy in South Africa stated that it hoped that this relationship would not only strengthen ties within South Africa but be a gateway for influencing the greater African market.\nChina Mobile\u2019s expansion into the Middle East has focused primarily in Dubai, where it set up an office in Dubai\u2019s Internet City, strengthened ties with the Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC) through the use of EITC\u2019s Datamena data centre, established network and mobile roaming partnerships with EITC\u2019s commercial brand, Du, and expressed its interest in bringing its work in artificial intelligence and the IoT to the Middle East. Du\u2019s CEO expressed his excitement at the prospect of leveraging Du\u2019s relationship with China Mobile to assist with its commitments to Smart City 2021.\nIn 2014, China Mobile bought an 18% stake in Thailand\u2019s communications conglomerate, True Corporation. It\u2019s the largest foreign investor in True and the second largest overall. The vice president of True, Li Zhengmao, is also a non-executive director of China Telecom\u2019s subsidiary, China ComService, through which he has an affiliation with Xiao Chuwang, China Unicom\u2019s chairman, who is also the chairman of China ComService.\nIn May 2020, it was reported that China Mobile was looking to purchase Digicel, which is the largest phone carrier in the Pacific islands, in a deal that immediately raised concerns in Australia about Chinese Government influence in the region.", "party_state": "Party-state Activities\nChina Mobile is a state-owned enterprise in an industry that the Chinese Government has placed on its \u2018negative list\u2019, which means that foreign investment into the industry is prohibited. Consequently, the party-state maintains significant levels of influence and control over the company. Its extensive coverage and level of subscriptions within China mean that China Mobile is able to dominate the domestic telecommunications market.\nThe members of the leadership team of China Mobile are all Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members. On 4 March 2019, during the \u2018two sessions\u2019 (China\u2019s largest annual political event), the Central Organisation Department announced the decision of the Chinese Government to transfer Yang Jie\u2015at that time the chairman of China Telecom\u2015to the position of China Mobile chairman.\nChina Mobile has an education department called China Mobile University, which is a training centre that seeks to nurture talented individuals in middle and senior management and in technical and business fields within the company. The university also performs innovation research. The curriculum includes the country\u2019s major policies, communications trends and development plans, as well as business management. Instructors include members of the State Council and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, managers of China Mobile Group and experts from universities such as the Central Party School and Tsinghua University.\nThe China Mobile Party School was established at the China Mobile University in 2012 and as an online party school education platform in late 2013.

In August 2020, the company predicted that its 2020 revenue would reach US$1.3 billion, up 80% from 2019. In May 2020, the company said that it was aiming to raise US$1 billion.\nIn 2020, SenseTime unveiled a series of new technologies aimed at containing the spread of Covid-19, such as the \u2018Smart AI Epidemic Prevention Solution\u2019 and the \u2018SenseMeteor Smart Commute System\u2019. As early as February 2020, the company said that it was rolling out \u2018a facial-recognition product that incorporates thermal imaging cameras to help spot people with elevated temperatures, and send pop-up alerts to users of the software\u2019. It added that its mask algorithm was not only able to detect people who aren\u2019t wearing face masks, but could also identify those wearing face coverings with \u2018high accuracy\u2019.\nAfter deploying these technologies in mainland China, the company started exporting. For example, Malaysian tech company G3 Global Berhad reportedly acquired SenseTime\u2019s Nebula-ITMDT and Thunder-E Thermal Imaging solutions to fight the spread of Covid-19. In June 2020, SenseTime International announced that it had been working with Singaporean telecommunications company M1 to deliver its contactless AI thermal scanner, SenseThunder-E mini, to Singapore\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises.\nSenseTime also started new overseas research partnerships related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

In 2015, the team appointed Xu Bing as CEO, and a year later the company started launching products. Those products now range from facial recognition to semiconductors and robot delivery.\nSenseTime is best known for its image-recognition technology used in surveillance cameras. It offers software to police bureaus in mainland China (for example, in Shenzhen and Yunnan, to help them identify live faces, crowd movement, car licence plate numbers and vehicle types, as well as for other national security and smart city projects. SenseTime also works with the Ministry of Public Security\u2019s Third Research Institute to develop the mainland\u2019s citizen identity network infrastructure.\nSenseTime\u2019s valuation soared in 2018 with plans by the Ministry of Public Security to plough billions of dollars into two government plans, called the Skynet Project (\u5929\u7f51\u5de5\u7a0b) and the Sharp Eyes Project (\u96ea\u4eae\u5de5\u7a0b), that aimed to comprehensively surveil China\u2019s 1.4 billion people by 2020 through a video camera network using facial-recognition technology.\nThose government contracts have helped SenseTime attract top venture capital and private equity firms, as well as strategic investors around the world, including Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank Group\u2019s Saudi-backed Vision Fund. US venture fund IDG Capital supplied \u2018tens of millions of dollars\u2019 in initial funding to the company in August 2014. Other major shareholders include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, London-based Fidelity International, Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings, US private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and Tiger Global Management, and the venture capital arm of US telco Qualcomm.\nMore than 17 US universities and public pension plans have put money into vehicles run by some of those venture capital funds, according to the Financial Times, citing historic PitchBook data (provided to ASPI ICPC with data last updated on 8 September 2018). In April 2019, the New York Times reported that SenseTime, along with other companies such as YITU, Megvii and CloudWalk, had built algorithms that the government uses to track and control Uyghurs.\nIn September 2019, SenseTime CEO Xu Li told a conference organised by Bloomberg in Singapore that the company doesn\u2019t do business directly with the government, but that its technology is employed by official agencies, such as the police, which buy its products through third parties. That didn\u2019t help to assuage the US Government\u2019s concerns, and in October the US Commerce Department barred SenseTime and other Chinese AI companies from buying US products or importing US technology, adding them to the US Government\u2019s Entity List. In response to the ban, SenseTime\u2019s founders said that they would start focusing more on facial-recognition software rather than hardware, which requires US-manufactured chips. According to some industry sources, however, the US ban didn\u2019t ultimately affect SenseTime\u2019s business operations as much as previously expected, due to the system\u2019s loopholes.\nIn March 2020, SenseTime delayed its plan to go public in Hong Kong, as it faced hurdles related to the US Entity List and the Covid-19 outbreak, which weakened the Hong Kong stock market; therefore, it\u2019s still listed as a private company.\nSenseTime has offices in Hong Kong, Kyoto, Tokyo and Singapore.", "areas_of_overseas": "Areas of Overseas Business Activity\nIn 2018, SenseTime was added to China\u2019s \u2018AI national team\u2019, which is a group of companies tasked with championing AI development for China.
