Since its founding in 1999, Alibaba has grown to be one of the world\u2019s largest companies. The conglomerate\u2019s US$25 billion initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 was the world\u2019s largest to date.\nLike any Chinese internet company listed on an overseas stock exchange, Alibaba was able to do so only via a legal structure known as \u2018variable interest entity\u2018, designed to get around China\u2019s foreign ownership laws. This investment method is highly risky, as Beijing could effectively confiscate the business at any time.\nDespite being one of China\u2019s premier internet companies, Alibaba has substantial foreign ownership, having sold significant stakes to Japanese conglomerate Softbank Group, which currently holds around 25%. As of January 2021, Alibaba\u2019s co-founder, Jack Ma (4.8%), together with co-founder and vice-chairman Joseph Tsai (11.9%) and Softbank Group are the company\u2019s controlling shareholders, followed by US asset management firm T Rowe Price Associates, Inc. (2.3%) and US investment firm BlackRock Fund Advisors (2%).", "areas_of_overseas": "Areas of Overseas Business Activity\nAlibaba focuses most of its investments on its core strengths as a company (e-commerce and logistics), and around 70% of those investments are in local Chinese firms. However, the company has also invested in various countries across the globe, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Singapore, the UAE and Switzerland. Its investment areas include biotech, logistics, security, food technology, media, cloud computing, payments, voice recognition, face recognition and health.\nThe company has made its most significant inroads overseas in Southeast Asia, which it refers to as \u2018an important region for our globalisation strategy\u2019 and where it boasts a strong lead over its US e-commerce rival, Amazon. In April 2016, Alibaba bought a controlling stake in Southeast Asian retailer Lazada Group for US$1 billion. It injected another US$3 billion into the business in the following years and replaced its CEO with a longstanding Alibaba executive.\nAlibaba\u2019s former chairman, Jack Ma, is a global ambassador for Chinese business and spruiks the benefits of open trade in meetings with heads of state and other foreign dignitaries at various world forums. Ma has linked Alibaba\u2019s international business expansion with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), telling the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2016 that the most important regions for his company were part of the BRI. When Ma met with then US President Donald Trump in January 2017, he promised that his company would help create 1 million jobs over five years in the US, but later went back on his promise, citing the ongoing US\u2013China trade war.\nOn 10 September 2019, Jack Ma retired and Daniel Zhang, who had been CEO since 2015, took over as the new chairman of Alibaba. Despite his retirement, Ma still holds a very high profile and is the de facto face of the company. When Chinese authorities started a crackdown on his two main companies (Alibaba and Ant Group), Ma disappeared from public view for several months after he voiced controversial critiques about the way China\u2019s regulators handle big businesses in the country. In January 2021, it was reported that Alibaba was subjected to an anti-trust investigation for \u2018suspected monopolistic practices\u2019 and fined almost US$100,000 for failing to comply with Chinese antitrust law. Additionally, in April, the company was fined an unprecedented US$2.8 billion for abusing \u2018its dominant position in the market\u2019. Commentators have described this as an emblematic case and an anti-monopoly statement by the government, as it was the first-time regulators went after such a high-profile Chinese tech company.\nAs of January 2021, Alibaba\u2019s active users were mostly China-based, but, looking ahead, Daniel Zhang has said that the company aims to reach more than 2 billion customers globally by 2036. This effort is being complemented with an increased focus on overseas influencer campaigns. As Beijing has cracked down on the company, however, Alibaba has reportedly halved its investment in start-ups over the second half of 2020.\nAlibaba\u2019s foreign investments haven\u2019t always been successful. On 2 January 2018, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) blocked the acquisition of Texas-based financial technology company, MoneyGram International, by Alibaba\u2019s financial arm, Ant Financial Services Group (See Ant Group under \u2018Companies\u2019). According to sources cited by Reuters, the deal was terminated after CFIUS rejected Ant Group\u2019s proposals to mitigate concerns over the safety of data that can be used to identify US citizens.", "party_state": "Party-state Activities\nSoon after its founding in 1999, a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) branch was established inside Alibaba; the branch was upgraded to a party committee in 2008. In total, there are almost 200 party branches and more than 7,000 party members at Alibaba and Ant Group, and around 600 new party members join the company every year. In March 2021, following the Chinese authorities\u2019 crackdown on Alibaba, the company opened a second party committee at its Beijing headquarters. At the founding ceremony for the committee, its secretary, Wang Hao, said that \u2018Alibaba should adhere to correct political directions and maintain political integrity.\u2019\nUnlike the CEOs who head the other two companies in the BAT troika (Baidu and Tencent), Alibaba\u2019s former head, Jack Ma, is a member of the CCP\u2015a fact that was only very recently revealed in the Chinese press. But, unlike Baidu\u2019s Robin Li and Tencent\u2019s Pony Ma, Jack Ma has never been appointed as a delegate to the National People\u2019s Congress. He was, however, a member of the 10th Zhejiang Provincial Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, from 2008 to 2012. Ma, alongside Baidu\u2019s Robin Li, was part of Xi Jinping\u2019s entourage when Xi became the first CCP General Secretary to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2017.\nAccording to a 2018 Reuters article, an Alibaba special projects team \u2018Y Projects Business Unit\u2019, which covers \u2018development projects outside the company\u2019, was responsible for developing the Party\u2019s Xuexi Qiangguo (\u2018Study to make China strong\u2019) mobile application. The CCP\u2019s Central Propaganda Department released the app, which was built using Alibaba\u2019s messaging app DingTalk. The ASPI ICPC report Engineering Global Consent found that Alibaba Cloud had a strategic cooperation agreement with the company Global Tone Communications Technology (GTCOM), which is the subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise directly controlled by the Central Propaganda Department. Alibaba is also one of several companies GTCOM claims it has collaborated with in the development of its technology, and GTCOM\u2019s US-based company also claimed to have reached strategic cooperation with Alibaba. \nAlibaba\u2019s technology is also used across China for government projects, for instance in smart cities projects. These projects typically involve the use of Alibaba\u2019s 'city brain' technology.", "activities_in_xinjiang": "Activities in Xinjiang\nAccording to a 2014 article in China Daily, \u2018Jack Ma and his top management team\u2019 visited Xinjiang, and signed a strategic partnership agreement with the Xinjiang government. As part of the agreement, the government said it would purchase Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing technologies to apply in areas of policing and counterterrorism.\nFor instance, Alibaba, together with Tencent and Hikvision, is reportedly involved in \u2018Smart Prison\u2019 projects across China. The projects are implemented across China, including in Xinjiang, according to reports by local prisons. \nSince the mass detention of Uyghurs in Xinjiang began in 2017, many Chinese companies have opened up \u2018satellite\u2019 factories in the province due to favourable government policies and abundant local labour (including forced labour). Uyghurs have been forced to work mostly for textile or electronics manufacturers, and some of the products are sold on Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce platforms. For instance, Yecheng Xiaoxiang Textile Company, which has satellite factories in Xinjiang, sells clothing on Alibaba\u2019s platforms to consumers in China, North America, Europe and the Middle East.\nIn December 2020, the New York Times reported that Alibaba had built a feature into its Cloud software to help online platforms \u2018detect the faces of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities\u2019, and showcased it on its website. Alibaba is also a substantial shareholder and partner of Megvii Technology Ltd, which is a Chinese AI company the US government has added to the Entity List for alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang. The partnership includes the provision of cloud services, storage and technical support to Megvii.", "privacy_policies": "Privacy Policies\nThe privacy policy on Alibaba\u2019s international website applies to the \u201ccollection, use and disclosure of information in connection with the products and services offered by Alibaba.com.\u201d Alibaba can transfer personal information \u201cto countries/regions outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)\u201d, including to jurisdictions where the data protection level \u201cis different from that of [a customer\u2019s] home country, such as the United States and China.\u201dAlibaba \u201cmay disclose (or provide) personal information to \u2026 third-party business partners, service providers and/or affiliates\u201d...\u201claw enforcement agencies, governments and regulatory and other agencies, if [Alibaba] believe that it is necessary to comply with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe privacy policy on Alibaba subsidiary Alibaba Cloud\u2019s International Website states that it applies to \u201chow we collect, use, transfer, retain, secure and disclose your personal data and/or personal data about your customers or end users that you provide to us pursuant to your use of the Alibaba Cloud Platform and/or our Cloud Services, as well as other terms relating to data location.\u201d It says that Alibaba Cloud can transfer personal information \u201cto countries/regions outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)\u201d, including to jurisdictions where the data protection level \u201cis different from that of [a customer\u2019s] home country, such as the United States and China.\u201d The policy adds that as it relates to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, \u201cAlibaba Cloud US LLC and Alibaba.com LLC are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Despite being the only company to disclose the use of de-identified user information to train algorithms in 2020, Alibaba hasn\u2019t published information about the rules governing the use of its algorithms.\nTech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent have raised privacy concerns about their handling of users\u2019 data not only abroad, but also at home, where people have long been asking for better policy regulations. Especially since Alibaba\u2019s efforts to grow its AI business and launch its own AI chip in 2018, foreign governments\u2019 scrutiny of the security implications of using Alibaba\u2019s services due to its ties to the Chinese Government has also increased.", "covid19": "Covid-19 Impact\nIn a May 2020 article, Reuters defined Alibaba as \u2018one of China\u2019s biggest corporate winners of the coronavirus crisis\u2019, as its online traffic went through the roof and the government expanded its reliance on Alibaba\u2019s cloud services to respond to the pandemic. In April 2020, the company announced that it would invest over US$28 billion in cloud infrastructure, in a push that was caused mainly by an increased reliance on the digital economy due to Covid-19 lockdowns.\nThe company has also been donating billions of dollars, not only to local small enterprises but also to overseas governments, in the form of masks and other Covid-19 protective equipment, as well as supporting efforts to accelerate vaccine production in China. Among other things, Alibaba opened an additional e-commerce platform exclusively dedicated to connecting overseas medical suppliers to Chinese hospitals. In Australia, the company has offered its cloud services to assist Australian universities with online education for their international students stranded in China."}, {"name": "Ant Group", "short_description": "Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, provides digital payment and financial technology platforms.

Ant Group has undergone rebranding twice since 2014. Alipay was first rebranded as Ant Financial in 2014, and later, in 2020, Ant Financial was rebranded as Ant Group. The 2020 rebranding was part of an effort to emphasise the tech rather than the finance aspect of the company in response to previous scrutiny from regulators. A spokesman said that the company wants to be referred to in English as \u2018Ant Group\u2019 Co. to better reflect its role as \u2018an innovative global technology provider\u2019 to businesses, which includes financial institutions.\nAlipay, owned by Ant Group and home to more than 1 billion users in mainland China, handled more than US$17 trillion in digital payment transactions in the first half of 2020, made unsecured short-term loans to roughly 500 million people and sold insurance policies, mutual funds and other investment products. In recent years, however, Ant has been scaling back its reliance on in-house financial products in response to Beijing\u2019s tightening regulations on China\u2019s fintech industry. In contrast to Ant Group, Tencent is considered more reserved in the financial space, and yet its WeChat Pay app has been slowly consuming Alipay\u2019s share of the payments market.\nAlipay has amassed data on many people\u2019s spending habits and payment patterns and has been leveraging that information to provide loans and sell investment products to its users. Alipay\u2019s e-wallet platform was previously available only to consumers with Chinese bank accounts and local mobile phone numbers, but the company recently expanded access to foreign visitors through an international version of Alipay. Despite the company\u2019s expansion, it has faced Chinese regulation hurdles that have potentially dropped Ant\u2019s valuation by 50%. Based on the company\u2019s 2020 performance, some of Ant\u2019s global investors valued it at over US$200 billion as of March 2021.\nIn November 2020, Ant Group was expected to launch the world\u2019s largest IPO, raising almost US$37 billion at a US$313 billion valuation. The company was pursuing a dual listing in Hong Kong and on Shanghai\u2019s STAR Market. In September 2020, however, China\u2019s central bank released rules that require firms operating two or more financial businesses in the country to be classified as financial-holding companies. Those regulations took effect on 1 November 2020, and were aimed at large state-owned and private conglomerates, including internet companies, that control financial business that could pose systemic risks. Ant Group, which is one of the companies targeted by the regulations, planned to comply with the new rules.\nIn October 2020, Ant received the \u2018final nod\u2019 from China\u2019s top securities regulator to register its Shanghai IPO. Later that same month, however, Ant founder Jack Ma gave a speech at a public event attended by Chinese regulators, during which he said that the financial and regulatory system stifled innovation and should be reformed to fuel growth. Approximately one week after Ma\u2019s speech, China\u2019s Financial Stability and Development Committee flagged risks associated with the rapid development of financial technology. In early November, Chinese regulators recommended tighter regulations for online micro-lending companies to help contain potential financial risks and rein in rising debt levels, resulting in regulatory talks conducted between Ant\u2019s top executives and four of China\u2019s top financial regulators.\nFinally, on 3 November, the Shanghai stock exchange suspended Ant\u2019s IPO, citing regulatory talks as a \u2018material event\u2019 and a tougher regulatory environment as factors that may disqualify Ant from pursuing its listing. That prompted Ant to freeze its Hong Kong listing, which had been expected to go public only days later. Ant\u2019s risk to the financial system and Ma\u2019s speech were reportedly not the only reasons in play for suspending the company\u2019s IPO. According to more than a dozen Chinese officials and government advisers, another key reason was \u2018growing unease in Beijing over Ant\u2019s complex ownership structure\u2014and the people who stood to gain most from what would have been the world\u2019s largest IPO\u2019. According to Wall Street Journal reporting, several of those beneficiaries were \u2018well-connected Chinese power players, including some with links to political families that represent a potential challenge to President Xi and his inner circle\u2019.\nAfter Ant\u2019s IPO was suspended, Chinese regulators launched an investigation into equity investments held by Ant Group in dozens of companies. As a result of the investigation, Chinese regulators ordered Ant Group to overhaul major aspects of its business due to \u2018major problems in Ant Group\u2019s business practices in China\u2019 that it had found. In February 2021, Ant Group and Chinese regulators agreed on a restructuring plan in which Ant Group will become a financial holding company overseen by China\u2019s central bank for all of its businesses. Additionally, new rules announced by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission will require online lending platforms\u2014including Ant Group\u2014to contribute 30% of the funding for loans they offer in partnership with banks. Previously, Ant Group had been funding only 2% of its loans; the remainder came from partner banks. Less than four months following the antitrust probe into Alibaba, China\u2019s antitrust regulators issued Ant Group a fine of $2.8 billion. \nAmid the company\u2019s restructuring, Simon Hu resigned as CEO of Ant Group in March 2021 and Eric Jing took on the role of CEO.", "areas_of_overseas": "Areas of Overseas Business Activity\nIncreasing competition in China in addition to Beijing\u2019s tightening regulations may weigh on Ant\u2019s ability to continue expanding domestically in China. Ant\u2019s China sales account for an estimated 95% of the company\u2019s revenue, increasing the likelihood that Ant will need to expand its overseas presence in order to compensate for the inevitable slowing in its growth domestically.\nTourism has been key in extending the reach of Alipay (as can be seen in the Middle East and in Africa), as China was the world\u2019s largest source of overseas tourists in 2018. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on travel, however, has limited Alipay\u2019s ability to expand its overseas presence through tourism. Ant has also been cutting funding to many of the overseas e-wallet firms that it invested in as the company reworks its priorities following the domestic challenges that its IPO faced.\nIn 2020, Ant halted its plan to create a global payments infrastructure based on a common QR code system connecting all the e-wallets it has invested in\u2014a plan that would have made Alipay a global payments leader. Ant\u2019s investments in fintech companies with e-wallet services have primarily focused on the Southeast Asia region, where the company has invested in more than a dozen companies.

In 2019, Nepal banned WeChat and Alipay, saying that payments from the systems were illegal and resulting in a loss of income to the Himalayan nation. Vietnam and Myanmar also joined in banning Alipay from operating in their countries. In January 2021, former US President Trump signed an executive order prohibiting transactions with Alipay, citing concerns that \u2018China has been using \u201cbulk data collection\u201d to advance its economic and national security agenda.\u2019\nPreviously, in 2018, Ant Group had planned to acquire US money transfer company MoneyGram International. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) rejected the plan, citing national security concerns as its reason. Later, in October 2020, the US Department of State submitted a proposal for the Trump administration to add Ant Group to the US\u2019s Entity List.\nDomestically, Ant Group has received criticism on several fronts for its data privacy policies. First, in 2015, it released a new version of the Alipay mobile app that did not require users to enter a \u2018gesture password\u2019 to open the app. Later, in 2018, it faced criticism when the app contained an agreement that automatically enrolled its users in its credit rating service, Sesame Credit, if they viewed their spending history. In response to this, a lawyer at Chinese Hui Ye Law Firm stated that \u2018under China\u2019s Cybersecurity Law, companies are permitted to collect customer data but they are also responsible for ensuring that the usage, storage and deletion of data are done within legal limits.\u2019\nFollowing the criticism, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a statement in 2018 saying that it had summoned Ant Group representatives to a meeting and told them that they had failed to meet the country\u2019s personal information security standards.", "covid19": "Covid-19 Impact\nIn response to Covid-19, Ant Group assisted the Chinese Government in developing and implementing the Alipay Health Code.

Baidu offers a suite of products and web services similar to its Western search counterpart, Google, as well as Baidu Baike\u2015a Chinese clone of Wikipedia. In recent years, Baidu has branched out into artificial intelligence (AI) research and is highly competitive in speech recognition and autonomous driving.\nSince its founding, Baidu has grown to become one of China\u2019s most successful internet companies. It leads in the field of search, and its search engine controls over 75% of the online search market share in the country. Baidu completed its initial public offering on the NASDAQ in 2006. In December 2007, it became the first Chinese company to be included in the NASDAQ 100 index. However, amid rising tensions between the US and China, in 2020 Baidu planned a second listing in Hong Kong and selected CLSA Ltd and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to raise at least US$3.5 billion.\nLike any Chinese internet company listed on an overseas stock exchange, Baidu was able to do so only via a legal structure known as a \u2018variable interest entity\u2019, which is designed to get around China\u2019s foreign ownership laws. Foreign investors face a real risk that Beijing could effectively confiscate the business at any time.\nThe company was one of the first in the world to clearly prioritise AI, setting up its Institute for Deep Learning in 2013, and is investing heavily in image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, robotics, big data and, more recently, autonomous driving, electric vehicles and biotechnology.\nBaidu\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and electric vehicles is mainly evident in its operations in mainland China. For example, in 2020, the company launched a public robotaxi service called Apollo Go Robotaxi in the cities of Beijing, Changsha and Cangzhou and opened the world\u2019s largest self-driving R&D centre in Beijing. In January 2021, Shanghai-based car company WM Motor launched a self-driving vehicle jointly developed with Baidu\u2019s Apollo, its autonomous driving platform. At the same time, Baidu announced that it would set up a new joint venture with Chinese automaker Geely to produce smart-driving electric vehicles.\nIn August 2020, as part of its AI efforts, Baidu launched what it claimed to be the world\u2019s largest Chinese natural language processing database, called Qian Yan (\u5343\u8a00), in collaboration with the China Computer Federation. At a press conference, Baidu Technical Committee Chairman Wu Hua said that the company aimed to \u2018build a worldwide Chinese information processing influence\u2019, anticipating a further overseas expansion of the company in this field.\nFigure 1: Baidu\u2019s corporate structure\nSource: Baidu 2019 annual report.", "areas_of_overseas": "Areas of Overseas Business Activity\nBaidu has offices in several countries other than China, including in India, Indonesia, Thailand and the US. Its strategy has been to select countries with large populations with developing mobile internet markets where it has the potential to expand quickly.\nDespite a concerted effort to internationalise its business, Baidu has so far had little success in expanding beyond China\u2019s borders. The company\u2019s first global foray came with the launch of a Japanese-language version of its search engine in 2008, but its reputation took a hit in late 2013 when it was discovered that Baidu\u2019s free Japanese-language Input Method Editor had been sending sensitive user information (such as passwords) back to Baidu servers in Japan, without users\u2019 consent. Baidu tried again in 2014 with the launch of a Portuguese-language version of its search engine in Brazil, called Busca. The launch, announced by CEO Robin Li in Brasilia, coincided with Xi Jinping\u2019s meeting with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Baidu, however, ended its operations in Brazil in mid-2018, five years after it launched there, reportedly due to a shift in its global strategy to focus on AI. It also shut down its search engine services in Egypt and Japan, but still provides advertising and other services in Japan.\nAs Baidu\u2019s attempts to expand its search business in Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East by entering the Brazilian and Egyptian markets failed, the company focused more on diversifying its areas of business and expanded its overseas operations in the AI and self-driving fields, particularly through its self-driving platform initiative, Apollo, which involves several car manufacturers overseas.", "party_state": "Party-state Activities\nSoon after its founding in 2000, Baidu established an internal general party branch, according to Chinese media reports.

In 2012, the second generation of BeiDou began operation, servicing the Asia\u2013Pacific region. In November 2019, state media reported that the 29th satellite had been launched. In June 2020, BeiDou completed the deployment of the BDS as it launched its 55th and final satellite, allowing China to no longer depend on the US Government\u2019s Global Positioning System (GPS). In recent years, the BDS has been described as being part of the Information Silk Road, Digital Silk Road and Space Silk Road, which are linked to the Belt and Road Initiative.\nIn 2014, BeiDou became the third satellite navigation system recognised by the UN body for operations at sea, after GPS and Russia\u2019s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). However, much of BeiDou\u2019s rise, according to reports, was thanks to technology partnerships between Beijing and the EU, after the US blocked support for China\u2019s satellite programs.\nChina has made efforts to promote BeiDou\u2019s application beyond its borders. So far, countries in Southeast Asia and the Arab League have been the most receptive. In November 2019, Beijing hosted representatives from Central Asian countries and signed research partnership deals with Uzbekistan. BeiDou has also built continuously operating reference stations (CORSs), centres and ground control stations with Chinese receivers in a number of countries, raising security concerns from experts.\nAccording to state media, as of June 2020, services linked to BeiDou had been exported to about 120 countries. After the completion of the BDS, Nikkei found that 85% of all the world\u2019s capital cities were observed more frequently by Beidou than by GPS satellites.

In 2014, Malaysia agreed to build a BeiDou data centre, and Singapore signed a deal to open a centre to develop BeiDou applications. In 2017, Sri Lanka agreed to develop at least 10 CORSs in the South Asian country. In 2018, a Chinese company won bids to build 1,046 BeiDou receivers in Indonesia, marking the biggest application project of BeiDou products. BeiDou services are also applied in Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Brunei.\nIn 2014, the satellite bodies of China and Australia agreed to establish a formal cooperation mechanism. The Australian side signed an agreement to operate three BeiDou/GNSS ground stations in Australia. In 2015, China launched the BeiDou satellite navigation system\u2019s Antarctic ground base station.\nIn addition to experts\u2019 security concerns in relation to BeiDou\u2019s CORSs in a number of countries, the US\u2013China Economic and Security Review Commission published, in May 2017, a report that highlighted the impact of the BDS on the US and several other security implications, mainly focused on its military applications.\nIn April 2018, BeiDou launched its first overseas centre in Tunis, marked by the first China \u2013 Arab States BDS Cooperation Forum. The centre was a pilot project between China and Tunisia to promote the global application of the BeiDou system in Arab states. Uganda built 15 base stations using BeiDou receivers, and agriculture workshops were held in Sudan to promote BeiDou technologies. In November 2018, at a meeting of the Xi\u2019an International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems, a Laotian scholar said that the BDS was being used in a Safe City project in Phongsaly, northern Laos, to maintain public security and position police forces and emergency vehicles, as reported by Xinhua. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, China held the first China \u2013 Central Asia BeiDou Cooperation Forum in late 2019 to promote BeiDou services to Central Asian countries. Uzbekistan signed an agreement to apply BeiDou technology in various areas. The Chinese Government and relevant companies and research institutes have also signed research cooperation agreements on BeiDou with parties from Canada, Mexico and Germany.\nThe Sweden Space Corporation, which is Sweden\u2019s state-owned space company, has had contracts allowing China to access its antennas in Sweden, Chile and Australia since 2011, covering weather- and Earth-monitoring satellites.

It operates several machine-learning-enabled content platforms and boasts more than 1 billion active users across its family of apps.\nThe company\u2019s AI-driven businesses\u2014such as its personalised news aggregator (Toutiao) and short video service (Douyin)\u2014are hugely popular inside China. Douyin, for example, had 600 million daily active users in 2020. In recent years, ByteDance has launched rebranded, international versions of its homegrown apps that are making significant inroads in international markets.\nTikTok, the overseas equivalent of ByteDance\u2019s Douyin video app, was the most downloaded iPhone app worldwide in the first quarter of 2018, topping Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. In November 2019, TikTok passed 1.5 billion downloads worldwide on the App Store and Google Play, according to mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower. ByteDance\u2019s suite of apps includes Helo, which is a social media platform focused on the Indian market, and BaBe (Baca Berita), Indonesia\u2019s leading news and content app.\nByteDance is one of the few major tech firms in China that\u2019s not owned or partially owned by the country\u2019s internet mega-giants, such as Tencent or Alibaba. In late 2018, a US$3 billion round of investment led by Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank Group valued the company at US$78 billion. Other major investors include the Chinese affiliate of US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, US private equity investor KKR, Chinese investment firm Hillhouse Capital and corporate venture unit SIG Asia. ByteDance is reportedly weighing an initial public offering in Hong Kong for 2021.\nDespite US threats to ban TikTok and India\u2019s ban of the app in 2020, ByteDance still saw its revenue more than double to about US$37 billion in 2020. The company generated more than US$7 billion in operating profit, compared with the less than US$4 billion in 2019. ByteDance\u2019s ad sales on its Chinese apps helped to offset any impact from India\u2019s ban and the US\u2019s threat of a ban. After ByteDance completed its US$5 billion funding round in December 2020, its valuation more than doubled to US$180 billion, making it the most highly valued venture-backed private tech company in the world.\nWithin China, ByteDance is reportedly planning to invest in local autonomous driving start-up QCraft Inc. ByteDance\u2019s investment will be at least US$25 million in QCraft\u2019s latest funding round, signalling the increasing involvement of big tech with car companies.", "areas_of_overseas": "Areas of Overseas Business Activity\nByteDance has clear global ambitions. The company\u2019s vision, as outlined on its website, is \u2018to build global creation and interaction platforms\u2019 that \u2018inform, educate, entertain and inspire people across languages, cultures and geographies\u2019.\nCEO Zhang Yiming has characterised the company\u2019s overseas expansion strategy as one of \u2018build and buy\u2019. That strategy has earned the company a portfolio of applications available in more than 150 markets and 75 languages. ByteDance had approximately 60,000 employees worldwide as of January 2020. Over the course of 2019, ByteDance said it more than tripled the number of its US employees.\nIn October 2016, ByteDance led a series D funding round of US$25 million for Dailyhunt, India\u2019s leading app for news and other content in local languages. In the same year, it obtained a controlling stake in Indonesian local-language news app BaBe (Baca Berita). TopBuzz\u2014a Toutiao-like news app developed by ByteDance\u2014started operation in the US in August 2015 and in Brazil in 2016 but was plagued by disinformation, resulting in ByteDance\u2019s decision to shut down the app.\nThe company is eyeing off multiple markets around the globe, including Japan, India, Southeast Asia, North America and Brazil, according to a speech by CEO Zhang Yiming at the third World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province, in November 2016. In December 2017, ByteDance executive Liu Zhen said that the company hoped to be earning half its revenue from outside China within the next five years.\nBy January 2019, TikTok had already entered more than 150 markets and had grown an audience of more than 500 million active users, according to ByteDance. It was the most downloaded app at Apple\u2019s App Store during the first quarter of 2019. Total installations of TikTok were estimated to be 1.2 billion worldwide in the same year, according to mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\nDespite US President Trump\u2019s attempts to ban TikTok and India\u2019s ban of the app, TikTok still experienced a record-setting first quarter in 2020, surpassing 2.6 billion downloads globally through the App Store and Google Play. Sensor Tower assessed that TikTok was the best rated top app in the US App Store in 2020.\nThe key to ByteDance\u2019s success with TikTok has been its decision to have dual versions of the app: Douyin, for China\u2019s internet-censored market, and TikTok, for markets beyond China\u2019s Great Firewall. The arrangement is designed to allow the app to grow a userbase in foreign markets without upsetting state censors back at home. In November 2019, citing anonymous sources, Reuters reported that ByteDance began to separate TikTok\u2019s product and business development, marketing and legal teams from Douyin in the third quarter of 2019.\nByteDance launched TikTok in 2017. Later that year, the company acquired Musical.ly, which is a mobile app that was hugely popular among young people in the US, in a deal worth between US$800 million and US$1 billion.\nByteDance also acquired Los Angeles\u2013based Flipagram, which is a video and photo creation app set to music clips, in 2017. It rebranded the app as Vigo Video. That was followed by a US$50 million investment in Live.me, which is a live-streaming app from Los Angeles that\u2019s majority-owned by Chinese mobile app developer Cheetah Mobile. ByteDance also agreed to spend US$86.6 million to acquire News Republic, a media aggregation service owned by Cheetah.\nByteDance\u2019s biggest and fastest growing market outside of China was India before the country banned 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok. The company had spent US$100 million on growing its market in India and planned to invest another US$1 billion in the country over the next three years. In 2018, the company launched Helo, which is another algorithmic app modelled on Toutiao and aimed at the Indian market with support for 14 local Indian languages. In April 2020, 30% of TikTok\u2019s downloads came from India; by June, the app had approximately 167 million users in the country.\nByteDance\u2019s path to growth in India had been far from smooth, as some regional governments tried to ban the app. In April 2019, it was temporarily removed from the Apple and Google app stores after a court in Chennai ruled that it had encouraged \u2018degrading culture\u2019 and could help \u2018sexual predators\u2019 to groom young victims. In June 2020, ByteDance\u2019s growth in India came to a close when the country banned 59 Chinese apps. India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology reviewed its ban decision again in January 2021 and announced that the 59 apps would remain banned in the interest of India\u2019s national security. Following the ban verdict in February 2021, TikTok essentially withdrew from India, significantly reducing its staffing in the country.\nThe company has faced a string of regulatory problems around the world. In July 2018, Indonesian authorities banned TikTok for containing \u2018pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy\u2019. The ban was overturned a week later after ByteDance agreed to clear \u2018all negative content\u2019 from the app and open an office in Indonesia to liaise with the government over content. Local Indonesian media have reported that TikTok has promised to set up a team of 20 censors in Indonesia charged with monitoring and sanitising content.\nIn late February 2019, TikTok agreed to a record US$5.7 million fine with the US Federal Trade Commission after being accused of illegally collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. That prompted the UK information commissioner to also launch an investigation into how the app handles the personal data of its young users and whether it prioritises the safety of children on its social network.\nIn late 2019, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers warned that TikTok could pose a national security risk and called on regulators and intelligence agencies to investigate the app\u2019s ties to China. In October, senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a joint letter to the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, asking for a national security review of the platform.\nThe following month, Senator Josh Hawley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s criminal justice and counterterrorism subcommittee, invited TikTok and Apple executives to testify at a hearing titled \u2018How corporations and big tech leave our data exposed to criminals, China, and other bad actors\u2019. The companies declined to appear. That same month, Reuters reported that the US Government had opened a national security investigation into ByteDance\u2019s acquisition of Musical.ly two years before.\nOn 7 July 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that he was considering a ban on TikTok, claiming that user information from the app would end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. Later, on July 31, President Trump announced that he planned to ban the app from the US. On 6 August, he issued an executive order banning \u2018transactions\u2019 between people in the US and ByteDance. The executive order required that an American company purchase TikTok\u2019s US business within 45 days\u2014a deadline that was extended to give ByteDance 90 days. In September 2020, President Trump approved a deal between Oracle, Walmart and TikTok that would result in the creation of a new entity: TikTok Global. In February 2021, the Biden administration asked that the ban be delayed to allow a review of the national security threats cited by the Trump administration.", "party_state": "Party-state Activities\nByteDance has had an established party branch since 2014 and established a party committee in 2017.\nIn October 2018, ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming was listed in the \u2018100 outstanding private entrepreneurs at the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up\u2019, according to state media reports cited by Week In China. The United Front Work Department of the CCP was reportedly heavily involved in the selection process for the list. which is published by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Business people chosen to feature on the list are chosen for being \u2018emblematic of the country\u2019s private economic development\u2019, while also being people who \u2018resolutely uphold the Party\u2019s leadership, unswervingly go along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and champion the reform and opening-up policies\u2019. \nBut ByteDance hasn\u2019t always been in the good graces of the CCP. The company has drawn the ire of the censors on more than one occasion. In April 2018, China\u2019s top media regulator ordered ByteDance to shut down its popular parody and meme app Neihan Duanzi. Vulgar content on the app had \u2018caused strong dislike among internet users\u2019, according to the State Administration of Radio and Television.\nThat prompted ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming to pledge to publicly apologise for \u2018publishing a product that collided with core socialist values\u2019 and to increase his team of censors from 6,000 to 10,000\u2014the job ads for which noted that candidates with \u2018strong political sensitivity\u2019 would be preferred.\nDespite the occasional reprimand from the censors, ByteDance appears to have been protected by Lu Wei, China\u2019s former internet czar, when its business rivals complained that the company was stealing their content. According to sources cited by the New York Times, one of Lu\u2019s top lieutenants told them that he was a fan and that they should stop complaining and work with the company. Had Lu cracked down on the company for its early questionable business practices, it might not have continued as a viable business.\nByteDance has supported and partnered with several cities and provinces to provide them with guidance to make better use of platforms such as Douyin and Toutiao to promote propaganda. That includes a cooperation agreement between ByteDance and Siping city in Jilin Province, Shanxi Province, Heilongjiang Province, and Rizhao city in Shandong Province. The cooperation agreement between ByteDance and the Rizhao government focused on facilitating \u2018Political Rizhao, Positive Energy\u2019 using ByteDance\u2019s Toutiao and Douyin platforms.", "activities_in_xinjiang": "Activities in Xinjiang\nByteDance collaborates with public security bureaus across China, including in Xinjiang, where it plays an active role in disseminating the party-state\u2019s propaganda about Xinjiang.\nXinjiang Internet Police reportedly \u2018arrived\u2019 on Douyin, ByteDance\u2019s and video-sharing app, and built a \u2018new public security and Internet social governance model\u2019 in 2018.\nIn April 2019, the Ministry of Public Security\u2019s Press and Propaganda Bureau signed a strategic cooperation agreement with ByteDance to promote the \u2018influence and credibility\u2019 of the police department nationwide. Under the agreement, all levels and divisions of police units from the Ministry of Public Security to county-level traffic police would have their own Douyin account to disseminate propaganda. The agreement also reportedly says that ByteDance would increase its offline cooperation with the police department; however, it\u2019s unclear what that offline cooperation is.\nAccording to the Xinjiang Public Security Federation of Literary and Art Circles\u2019 WeChat account, it along with new media platform Ping An Tianshan collaborated to spread information regarding Xinjiang\u2019s public security via online platforms including Douyin. The Ping An Tianshan Douyin account has accumulated hundreds of millions of views and over one million followers. Douyin is also used as a platform for the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to, for example, publicize the \u201cCommunity Correction Law.\u201d\nIn November 2019, the Beijing Radio and Television Bureau announced its \u2018Xinjiang Aid\u2019 measures in Hotan to \u2018propagate and showcase Hotan\u2019s new image\u2019\u2014after more than two years of mass detention and close surveillance of ethnic minorities had taken place there. The measures include guiding and helping local Xinjiang authorities and media outlets to use ByteDance\u2019s news aggregation app for Jinri Toutiao (Today\u2019s Headlines) and video-sharing app Douyin to gain traction online. A Tianjin Daily article reported in March 2019 that, after listening to talks by representatives from ByteDance\u2019s Jinri Toutiao division, Hotan Propaganda Bureau official Zhou Nengwen said that he was excited to use the Douyin platform to promote Hotan\u2019s products and image.", "privacy_policies": "Privacy Policies\nAccording to the privacy policy for the ByteDance security centre, applied to users of the ByteDance security centre website, the company may collect, use and store personal information.

The ByteDance Institute of Public Policy has published a report summary titled Urban Spectrum\u2014research report on netizen reading preferences in the first half of 2018, which summarised reader preferences based on data collected by Jinri Toutiao. The report analysed data from users in 366 cities across China in the first half of 2018 on a city-by-city basis. According to the ByteDance Institute of Public Policy, by analysing users at the city level, it was able to \u2018obtain the changing patterns of urban cultural temperament\u2019 for each of the 366 cities. The institute released the report in the hope that \u2018the \u201cUrban Spectrum\u201d can become a tool to observe the development and changes of urban culture, so that information can serve society and create value\u2019. The institute announced that its people \u2018hope to cooperate extensively with all sectors of society to provide new ideas and plans for social governance\u2019.\nOutside of China, TikTok has been under scrutiny globally over security and privacy concerns, resulting in lawsuits and threats to ban the app. In February 2020, ByteDance agreed to pay US$92 million in a settlement to US users who filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that TikTok failed to obtain users\u2019 consent to collect data, in violation of an Illinois privacy law.

Hikvision was later added to the US Government\u2019s Entity List in October 2019. Its addition was the result of Hikvision\u2019s involvement in \u2018human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the XUAR\u2019.\nHikvision has employed lobbying firms in the US, including Sidley Austin LLP (2020), the Glover Park Group LLC (2019), Arent Fox and Mercury Public Affairs. Sidley Austin and the Glover Park Group have both assisted Hikvision on issues associated with \u2018prohibitions on certain video surveillance equipment in the National Defense Authorization Act\u2019. In 2018, Hikvision hired Mercury Public Affairs under a one-year US$840,000 agreement to determine the impact of the National Defence Authorization Act on the company. In 2019, the company hired Arent Fox to conduct a review of the company\u2019s human rights compliance.", "party_state": "Party-state Activities\nHikvision is state-controlled, and its chairman, Chen Zongnian, is also secretary of the CETHIK Group party committee.

The project included a surveillance system for the Justice Bureau\u2019s \u2018Transformation through Education Centre\u2019, which refers to Xinjiang\u2019s re-education detention camps. The project also included a video surveillance system for mosques that would serve as a replacement for local imams by streaming government-approved sermons on Hikvision\u2019s videoconferencing system.\nIn 2017, Hikvision signed a \u04b0309 million (US$43.9 million) contract to build a security-related project in Xinjiang\u2019s Moyu County. A tender obtained by Agence France-Presse detailed a network of around 35,000 cameras that would monitor the county\u2019s schools, streets and offices and 967 mosques, where they will ensure that imams use a \u2018unified\u2019 government script.\nIn 2017, Hikvision also won several other similar bids to build PPP (public\u2013private partnership) projects for local Xinjiang governments, including:\nthe Urumqi Hi-Tech Zone Safe City Project\u2014also referred to as the Urumqi High-tech Zone (New Urban Zone) Safe City and Surveillance system for Social Comprehensive Management\u2014with a total investment of \u04b0500 million (US$77 million)\nthe Yutian County Safe City PPP Project with a total investment of \u04b0368 million (US$57 million)\nthe Lop County Social Security PPP Project\u2014also referred to as the LuoPu Security Protection and Prevention Control System\u2014with a total investment of \u04b0356 million (US$55 million)\nthe Pishan Security Protection and Prevention Control System PPP Project with a total investment of \u04b0335 million (US$52 million)\nthe Karakax County Social Defence System PPP Project\u2014also referred to as the MoYu Security Protection and Prevention Control System\u2014with a total investment of \u04b0300 million (US$46 million).\nThe projects are ongoing until dates ranging from 2028 to 2040.\nIn 2019, Hikvision advertised an AI camera with capabilities to recognise and racially profile Uyghurs. In 2020, the company addressed objections to its Uyghur-recognition software by claiming to have removed the function from its cameras. Hikvision is one of several Chinese security camera manufacturers that offer \u2018Uyghurs analytics\u2019\u2014a function that was included in the Ministry of Public Security\u2019s draft facial-recognition guidelines in 2017. In March 2021, IPVM noted that Hikvision was one of several companies represented on a Technical Committee that helped to write Chinese police video surveillance standards.

Ltd; however, the specifics of this ownership arrangement are opaque. Founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei reportedly owns approximately 1% of the shares. In 2013, chief financial officer Sabrina Meng (also known as Cathy Meng) indicated that the company would provide more information about its ownership, but little has emerged since then. Approximately half of Huawei employees own shares in the company. Sources inside the company have claimed that only staff who are Chinese citizens and have performed well for three years are able to join the ownership program.\nDespite Huawei\u2019s \u2018employee\u2019 ownership model, its lack of transparency about shareholders and how decisions are made in practice has led to unease over Huawei\u2019s governance. While Huawei\u2019s board is selected by a group of representatives who are elected by shareholding employees, Ren Zhengfei holds veto power over company decisions. Furthermore, a 2012 US Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report on Huawei and ZTE stated that \u2018many analysts believe that Huawei is not actually controlled by its common shareholders but actually controlled by an elite subset of its management.\u2019\nOn 16 May 2019, Huawei\u2014and 68 of its non-US affiliates\u2014were added to the US Government's Entity List. On 19 August, 46 additional Huawei affiliates were added to the list. In November 2019, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was set to once again extend a licence that would allow American companies to continue doing business with Huawei. In August 2020, 38 additional non-US affiliates of Huawei were added to the US Entity List.\nIn August 2019, Huawei was added to China\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) \u2018national team\u2019, tasked with spearheading AI research.

Throughout 2019, and despite being placed on the US Entity List in May 2019, Huawei saw impressive growth in its smartphone sales and sat in second spot behind Samsung in terms of global market share. Since 2019, however, US sanctions have had a greater impact on Huawei: its shipments in 2020 were 21% lower than in 2019. The company also dropped out of the top five best-selling smartphone manufacturers entirely in the fourth quarter of 2020\u2014the first time in six years that Huawei hadn\u2019t maintained its spot in the top five.\nFollowing the US\u2019s ban on Huawei, Google cut off Huawei\u2019s Android licence, essentially leaving Huawei\u2019s smartphones without an operating system. As a result, Huawei created an alternative operating system, HarmonyOS. Huawei originally pitched HarmonyOS as a distinct OS from the Android and iOS, but after releasing smartphones equipped with the new HarmonyOS it became evident that HarmonyOS is an Android fork. Huawei set a goal to sell at least 200 million HarmonyOS-based devices in 2021.\nAlongside European companies Ericsson and Nokia, Huawei is one of the key providers of 5G technology. It\u2019s also been a major global provider of telecommunications infrastructure, particularly in developing countries.\nHuawei is also very active in smart cities projects, surveillance technologies and public security projects. The company claims to provide smart city solutions in 90 countries and 230 cities. One of its more recent smart city projects is in Myanmar.\nASPI\u2019s research has found that in developing countries the exponential growth of Huawei\u2019s smart city and public security solutions is being driven by China Eximbank loans (for more detail, read the case study in our ASPI report Mapping China\u2019s technology giants).\nIn many of the smart city projects we examined, Huawei was awarded the primary contract; in some cases, the contract was managed by a Chinese state-owned enterprise (for example, in the case of Ecuador\u2019s ECU 911 system) and Huawei played a \u2018sub-awardee\u2019 role as a provider of surveillance equipment and services.\nHuawei\u2019s \u2018e-governance solutions\u2019 and telecommunications projects are also often funded by Chinese loans through China Eximbank or the China Development Bank (for example, in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Samoa, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Russia, Brazil, and Uzbekistan).\nIn June 2019, Huawei announced that it would be selling its submarine cable subsidiary, Huawei Marine, which is one of the world\u2019s main builders of submarine cables.

The company provides products to clients in Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea, India, Italy, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore and France. Under the instruction of China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, Meiya Pico claims to have provided more than 50 training courses to police forces in 30 countries as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. A report on Chinese information controls suggests that this could be part of a \u2018safety corridor\u2019 between China and Europe, created by linking safety and security products and services with international development projects (for more detail, read the case study in our ASPI report, Mapping More of China\u2019s Tech Giants: AI and Surveillance).\nSince 2013, Meiya Pico has been working with the Ministry of Public Security to construct digital forensics laboratories in Southeast Asia and Central Asia, with a focus on developing countries along the \u2018Belt and Road\u2019, such as the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security in Ho Chi Minh City. China provided financial aid for that project. The company has also held training sessions and workshops for military and police forces in South and Southeast Asia (for example, in Sri Lanka).\nMeiya Pico\u2019s Forensic Magic Cube, marketed as the \u2018Swiss army knife of forensics\u2019, has been sold to Turkmenistan and the Russian military.\nAfter being listed on the US\u2019s Entity List in October 2019, Meiya Pico stated that it wasn\u2019t concerned, as overseas sales contributed less than 1% of its overall sales revenue and were mainly from neighbouring countries and those linked to the Belt and Road Initiative.\nSince at least 2018, Meiya Pico shares have been included as part of the FTSE Russell Global Equity Index.", "party_state": "Party-state Activities\nIn 2007, Meiya Pico established a party organisation that currently has 24 grassroots branches and 488 party members.\nThere\u2019s significant CCP interest in Meiya Pico, indicated by the visits of various party leaders to the company that are listed on its website under the heading \u2018Leadership concern\u2019.

At the same time, it vigorously practices the national strategy of Belt and Road Initiative and military\u2013civil fusion\u2019.\nMeiya Pico\u2019s primary customers are domestic law enforcement. Since at least 2007, the company has trained 50,000 law enforcement officers and received the title of \u2018National Cyber Police Training Center\u2019 from the Ministry of Public Security. Meiya Pico has trained overseas law enforcement officers not just as part of its \u2018global reaching out\u2019, but following the direction of the Ministry of Public Security to train countries along the Belt and Road.

It\u2019s headquartered in Beijing and claims to have customers in more than 160 countries and regions. Its parent company is controlled by the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).\nFounded in 1997, Nuctech is a leading security screening products manufacturer and services provider. Nicknamed \u2018the Huawei of airport security\u2019, the company sells advanced security and inspection products, including cargo and vehicle inspection systems, X-ray machines, body scanners and narcotics- and explosives-detection devices. In addition to being used at airports, Nuctech\u2019s products are used in a range of settings, such as border checkpoints, law enforcement and justice facilities and large events.\nOriginally known as the Tsinghua Tongfang Nuclear Technology Co., Nuctech received backing from the Chinese Government to commercialise Tsinghua University\u2019s research into radiation imaging technologies. It\u2019s a subsidiary of Tsinghua Tongfang, which was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1997. Since January 2020, Tongfang has been officially majority-owned by the CNNC, which is designated \u2018very high risk\u2019 in the ASPI China Defence Universities Tracker database. Two CNNC subsidiaries have also been added to the US Government\u2019s Entity List.\nIn 2020, Nuctech ranked 46th among China\u2019s top 100 technology innovation companies, according to a report supported by the Intellectual Property Development and Research Centre, which is affiliated with the China National Intellectual Property Administration.\nDespite its market success, Nuctech has been accused of involvement in corruption cases in countries including Namibia and Taiwan. In 2010, the EU accused Nuctech of dumping. According to the New York Times, Nuctech orders were often negotiated as part of broader trade talks handled by the Chinese Government. Complaints about Nuctech include that it has used government funding to cover its research costs, provided preferential loans and extended warranties, and used high-level connections to win contracts from foreign governments.\nIn December 2020, the US Government added Nuctech to its Entity List for the company\u2019s \u2018involvement in activities that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States. Specifically, the ERC [End-User Review Committee] determined NucTech\u2019s lower-performing equipment impair US efforts to counter illicit international trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials. Lower performing equipment means less stringent cargo screening, raising the risk of proliferation.\u2019 The company\u2019s close ties with the Chinese Government and China\u2019s defence sector have raised security concerns in Europe, the US and Canada. In 2014, the US Transportation Security Administration barred Nuctech from much of the American airport market. In November 2020, after a security review, the Canadian Government rejected a contract with Nuctech to install and operate X-ray scanners in Canadian embassies around the world. In December 2020, the Lithuanian Government announced that it would launch a review into Nuctech over security concerns, and, in February 2021, it blocked the installation of Nuctech equipment at Lithuanian airports because of national security concerns.", "areas_of_overseas": "Areas of Overseas Business Activity\nNuctech is one of the key players globally in radiation detection in the military and security markets. In 2020, it reportedly held 15.6% of the global security screening market and the biggest share in the cargo inspection market.\nThe company\u2019s global expansion started in Australia. In 2001, it received its first overseas order from Australian Customs. Since then, Nuctech has been a regular supplier of security products for Australia\u2019s federal and state government agencies. The company claims that its products have been installed in more than 50 countries involved in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, that it has the biggest share of the African market for cargo inspection and intelligent security screening systems, and that 38 African countries use Nuctech products. According to a 2020 article in the Wall Street Journal, Nuctech has sold over \u20ac173 million worth of security inspection products to EU countries.\nNuctech\u2019s global expansion benefits from the involvement of the Chinese Government in different ways, such as providing concessional loans or grants to foreign governments or entities to buy Nuctech products.\nIn 2007, for example, according to the New York Times, the Chinese Government gave a big low-interest loan to Namibia to buy US$55.3 million worth of Chinese-made cargo-inspection equipment from a company selected by China after PRC President Hu Jintao visited Namibia. The selected company was Nuctech, which was led by Hu Haifeng, son of Hu Jintao. The loan agreement, which specified the purchase of Nuctech equipment, was signed between China\u2019s Ambassador to Namibia on behalf of the Chinese Government and by the Namibian Government.\nIn 2019, Nuctech\u2019s president signed an agreement with the chairman of the Kazakhstan State Revenue Committee to upgrade the customs command centre in the capital and facilities at border checkpoints. The project, worth \u04b02.62 billion, is funded by the China Eximbank, which is a state-funded and state-owned policy bank \u2018dedicated to supporting China\u2019s foreign trade, investment and international economic cooperation\u2019.\nNuctech used China\u2019s national credit resources to offload non-payment risks. According to the official China News in 2002, with insurance provided by the China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (or SINOSURE), Nuctech won an order worth US$47 million to supply cargo-inspection equipment to Venezuela, which at the time was politically unstable. SINOSURE, established in 2001, is a state-funded and policy-oriented insurance company that takes an \u2018active role in fulfilling the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d Initiative, guiding enterprises to use national credit resources, carrying out scientific and technological innovation and technological upgrading, and striving to help \u201cgoing out\u201d enterprises become more competitive in the global market\u2019, according to the company\u2019s website. In 2005, again underwritten by SINOSURE, Nuctech won a large contract from the Argentinian Government. In the same year, Nuctech\u2019s subsidiary in Argentina was established.

SenseTime also works with the Ministry of Public Security\u2019s Third Research Institute to develop the mainland\u2019s citizen identity network infrastructure.\nSenseTime\u2019s valuation soared in 2018 with plans by the Ministry of Public Security to plough billions of dollars into two government plans, called the Skynet Project (\u5929\u7f51\u5de5\u7a0b) and the Sharp Eyes Project (\u96ea\u4eae\u5de5\u7a0b), that aimed to comprehensively surveil China\u2019s 1.4 billion people by 2020 through a video camera network using facial-recognition technology.\nThose government contracts have helped SenseTime attract top venture capital and private equity firms, as well as strategic investors around the world, including Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank Group\u2019s Saudi-backed Vision Fund. US venture fund IDG Capital supplied \u2018tens of millions of dollars\u2019 in initial funding to the company in August 2014. Other major shareholders include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, London-based Fidelity International, Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings, US private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and Tiger Global Management, and the venture capital arm of US telco Qualcomm.\nMore than 17 US universities and public pension plans have put money into vehicles run by some of those venture capital funds, according to the Financial Times, citing historic PitchBook data (provided to ASPI ICPC with data last updated on 8 September 2018). In April 2019, the New York Times reported that SenseTime, along with other companies such as YITU, Megvii and CloudWalk, had built algorithms that the government uses to track and control Uyghurs.\nIn September 2019, SenseTime CEO Xu Li told a conference organised by Bloomberg in Singapore that the company doesn\u2019t do business directly with the government, but that its technology is employed by official agencies, such as the police, which buy its products through third parties. That didn\u2019t help to assuage the US Government\u2019s concerns, and in October the US Commerce Department barred SenseTime and other Chinese AI companies from buying US products or importing US technology, adding them to the US Government\u2019s Entity List. In response to the ban, SenseTime\u2019s founders said that they would start focusing more on facial-recognition software rather than hardware, which requires US-manufactured chips. According to some industry sources, however, the US ban didn\u2019t ultimately affect SenseTime\u2019s business operations as much as previously expected, due to the system\u2019s loopholes.\nIn March 2020, SenseTime delayed its plan to go public in Hong Kong, as it faced hurdles related to the US Entity List and the Covid-19 outbreak, which weakened the Hong Kong stock market; therefore, it\u2019s still listed as a private company.\nSenseTime has offices in Hong Kong, Kyoto, Tokyo and Singapore.", "areas_of_overseas": "Areas of Overseas Business Activity\nIn 2018, SenseTime was added to China\u2019s \u2018AI national team\u2019, which is a group of companies tasked with championing AI development for China.

In August 2020, the company predicted that its 2020 revenue would reach US$1.3 billion, up 80% from 2019. In May 2020, the company said that it was aiming to raise US$1 billion.\nIn 2020, SenseTime unveiled a series of new technologies aimed at containing the spread of Covid-19, such as the \u2018Smart AI Epidemic Prevention Solution\u2019 and the \u2018SenseMeteor Smart Commute System\u2019. As early as February 2020, the company said that it was rolling out \u2018a facial-recognition product that incorporates thermal imaging cameras to help spot people with elevated temperatures, and send pop-up alerts to users of the software\u2019. It added that its mask algorithm was not only able to detect people who aren\u2019t wearing face masks, but could also identify those wearing face coverings with \u2018high accuracy\u2019.\nAfter deploying these technologies in mainland China, the company started exporting. For example, Malaysian tech company G3 Global Berhad reportedly acquired SenseTime\u2019s Nebula-ITMDT and Thunder-E Thermal Imaging solutions to fight the spread of Covid-19. In June 2020, SenseTime International announced that it had been working with Singaporean telecommunications company M1 to deliver its contactless AI thermal scanner, SenseThunder-E mini, to Singapore\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises.\nSenseTime also started new overseas research partnerships related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The company, through its subsidiaries, provides a variety of internet-related services and products, including social media, entertainment, e-commerce, online advertising, gaming and artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn 2020, according to Newzoo.com, Tencent was the world\u2019s largest gaming company, by revenue, at US$7.2 billion.\nTencent went public and was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in June 2004 and was added as a constituent stock of the Hang Seng Index in June 2008. In early 2018, Tencent overtook US rival Facebook to become the world\u2019s most valuable social network company and the fifth most valuable company overall, with a market capitalisation of US$540 billion. Tencent\u2019s market capitalisation in February 2021 had grown to just over US$818 billion.\nTencent\u2019s largest shareholder is South African media group Naspers. In March 2019, Naspers announced that it would spin off a company made up of its investments in tech firms\u2014including in Tencent\u2014and list it in Amsterdam.\nLike any Chinese internet company listed on an overseas stock exchange, Tencent was only able to do so via a legal structure, known as a \u2018variable interest entity\u2019, that\u2019s designed to get around China\u2019s foreign ownership laws. The legality of the arrangement is shaky at best, and foreign investors face a real risk that Beijing could effectively confiscate the business at any time.\nTencent achieved early success in 1999 with QQ messenger, which was a desktop chat program based on the popular ICQ protocol. The arrival of mobile internet changed things drastically in 2011 with the launch of WeChat, which is a multipurpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app developed by the company.\nIn January 2020, Tencent announced that daily active users of WeChat had exceeded 1.2 billion. An estimated 100\u2013200 million people outside China use WeChat, mainly in Southeast Asia.\nAside from its messaging app, Tencent\u2019s most significant products are games that make up the world\u2019s biggest mobile gaming franchise. It has invested in game companies across the globe, including Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite; League of Legends creator Riot Games; Supercell, the Finnish firm behind Clash Of Clans; Korea\u2019s CJ Games; and Glu Mobile.\nTencent\u2019s gaming division has been an important part of its revenue stream, but regulatory hurdles at home are forcing the company to seek growth in other areas, such as cloud computing.\nIn August 2020, the Trump administration issued two executive orders banning US transactions with ByteDance and Tencent after a deadline of 20 September. However, the matter went to federal court in California, where a judge issued a preliminary injunction halting the ban, saying that the ban would harm the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights.\nAs recently as January 2021, US State Department and Defense Department officials were still discussing the addition of Tencent to the US Government\u2019s Entity List of companies barred from US investments because of their alleged ties to China\u2019s military and security services.

That led to speculation on social media that the swap was done to appease China.\nTencent\u2019s investment portfolio dwarfs those of US peers Facebook and Google. It has made more than 700 investments across the world, and, in 400 of them, it has taken board positions. Some 30%\u201340% of the company\u2019s investments are outside China.
